This isn’t a law passed by Congress so will be in effect only so long as a Republican holds the Oval Office. 

So this SPRING, show up and vote in the primaries.
This NOVEMBER, show up and vote in the general.

Show up and frigging vote even if the Democratic candidates don’t have a perfect history of agreeing with you on every issue, incising this one. 

Because frankly, the reason we’re all in this position is not because the country has more Republicans than Democrats, but because too many democrats stayed home on Election Day to “protest” their choice, while Republicans - goaded by armies of social media bots and right wing media - turned out. 

Look at the data - voter participation under 30 dropped significantly, and it was only 50% in the last presidential election. If 50% had turned out again, it would’ve canceled out the gains Trump made with Hispanic and Black voters switching to trump this year. 

Vote. Every. Time. Every. Year. No. Exceptions.Not surprised, but sad for people having to deal with that. If you study the collapse of empires, social regression is rather easy to predict. I saw this coming. Same with Roe v Wade, and they will make gay marriage illegal next.


Abortions have always existed in human history, its just the methods would change. So after abortion is usually outlawed...eventually women get murdered/executed within a decade. Some countries have hunted women that had them. Texas is already aiming for this. 


LGBT rights disappear and are forced back into hiding. So typically countries that had trans rights, they are no longer respected. Gay marriage is often overturned. 


So my husband and I decided to leave when they overturned Roe v Wade just because I refuse to live in a country where I don't have equal rights. 


I recommend whomever has the courage, to do all you can to leave the US. We regret not moving sooner. The part I just cannot understand how they cannot understand: Why would anyone willingly subject themselves to this kind of hate and vitriol if it were not who they truly were. That is like saying a black person does not exist or that a Latino does not exist. It is who they are and for someone making a "choice," you all sure are subjecting yourselves to a lot of hardship for no reason, right? 

It is such a stupid way of viewing people. My son thinks he may be LGBTQ and is catching a lot of flak for it in our hopelessly red state. He says the same thing. If it were not who he truly felt he was, why would he willingly subject himself to the hateful and ignorant actions of others? 

Why can't we just let people live their damn lives? You being you is no threat to me being me. I have become friends with a trans man who works at the gas station I go to every morning and I really do feel bad for what he has to endure. I have witnessed him catching hate personally and it is infuriating. I nearly got into an altercation with some ignorant asshole one morning a few months ago for his hateful comments. The manager stepped in on my friend's behalf, and this guy is, thankfully, no longer welcome in that gas station. He is not harming anyone by simply existing. In fact, he is kind to everyone (even the aforementioned asshole) and there is absolutely no reason to hate him. I am not sure it means much to you, but I stand with you. Live your true self. Believe it or not, the majority of us support your rights. The vocal minority has scored a victory in the battle but I am confident the war will be won by reason and tolerance.Yes please do. As for anyone saying that republicans by and large wish no ill will against you, they’re misguided. Even if they don’t personally kick, stab, kill you, they vote for the idea that maybe kicking, stabbing, killing you, is sorta kinda warranted. They think it sounds ok and good to be selective about who has rights based on moral guiding lights, and then they justify these things by becoming the guardians of who is “good” or “bad” among groups. “Oh we’re gonna get rid of them pesky brown folks, but don’t worry, I’ll protect you (my neighbor, friend, worker) because you’re one of the good ones’”. Or they say “well as long as I don’t have to see it, or you keep it to yourself” which is equivalent to saying “you’re not a real person” and when that rhetoric takes hold it leads to people brutalizing these outcasts just for having the nerve of allowing themselves to be seen. 

What it is is a slippery slope that dehumanizes people within our society and permits the defense of violent acts against these people. Violence takes many forms both physical and societal. Violence can be enacted on others by systematically denying them rights and existence within our society. The act of doing so can reduce people to homelessness, suicide, and to dangerous health outcomes when they lack the ability to receive medical care either from not being able to function in society (get a job, benefits etc) or by flat out being denied medical care. Supporting this rhetoric also leads us dangerously close to outright exterminating people for being non-humans. It’s not a far leap really and rolling their eyes at that assessment just further shows the naïve complacency these people have adopted. “Oh it won’t be like that” until the crosshairs hit the “good ones” they know, and then themselves. 

These violent acts, whether direct or indirect, all develop a dangerous pathway for the groups that are placed on the receiving end, and then others after that. So no, no it is not the easiest choice or act you can embark on. No it is not just “easy” to keep on being you when people are being emboldened to first look at you with pity and then rage and hate. America should not be going back here, yet here we are. So please accept my gratitude that you are not beaten down, and my sincere desire that you continue to not relent to this effort to snuff out the validation that you are in fact a person who is worth as much as every other person is.One slight difference. Nazi persecution of trans, gay, gypsy, jewish etc. people was initially motivated by the need to punch down. Hitler knew that Germany, as weakened as it was needed an Enemy presented to serve as a unifying force. Don't need to explain that, pretty standard politics. And enemies he had to spare, France, UK, Poland, etc. Problem he was facing was that each of those, if cast as the capital E enemy could proceed to wipe the floor with him for the slight, and doing nothing would not only cost him his power, but keep Germany on it's road to state failure and eventually becoming divied up by it's much stronger neighbors. What the Nazis did was successfully convince enough germans that the above groups were to blame for enough problems to catalyze the resulting support into other successes(worker housing for instance) and did enough right to out develop their neighbors. Given at great and tragic cost to the above mentioned groups, but it did work given we still have a Germany to criticize now(and an entire world order based on not playing with that particular fire again). Of course, dissidents got swept up as well, again standard politics. Being a dissident was never a safe occupation.
Here's my question. What the hell is Trump punching down for? Hitler,  starting out had the Great Powers on his ass and no army or economy to speak of. Trump has the single most dangerous army in the world, had at least strong alliances with most of the other strong countries and his geopolitical enemies were either in total collapse or playing a game of catch-up they couldn't win. At this point he's persecuting people for the hell of it. And he's parading it on day 1. Literally worse than Hitler.The US no longer has allies. The president responsible was re-elected, so ignorance is no longer an excuse. It was plain that his new cabinet would be the like minded authoritarian, racist isolationists and corrupt, expendable yes men that owe him everything. This is what the voters wanted. Trump's policy is one of strictly transactional, win lose relationships, with an attitude of  distrust and hostility for democracies. No allies and no NATO in particular. There is no way Trump is honouring any agreement in case of an European war with Russia. He will ask 'What's in it for me?' and even if Europe caves, it will not be enough. When in doubt, he'll call Putin. This should be obvious, but Europe remains in denial. Trump is only interested in self enrichment, now guaranteed, land grab of valuable, militarily weak territories, full control of all media, a Christian Fundamentalist ethno-theocracy and total impunity for it's soon to be trillionaires.They have a very distinct hierarchical view of the sexes - intelligent powerful male is superior to foolish weak female.  So the idea of a 'female' 'wanting to be male' makes logical sense to them - that's trying to IMPROVE your standing.  It might not 'be real' (in their minds), but it's not a threat, because it's what they see as a natural progression, and they can also only imagine the sort of male they'd be able to compete against for a woman's attention and win.  A FtM dude is not a threat to them in the same way.

But a 'male' 'wanting to be female' is innately perverse to them because it violates the hierarchy.  It's the source of much more fear - does that mean these people don't recognise me as innately more worthy because I'm male?!  What if I find a woman hot and it turns out she's MtF?  THAT WOULD MAKE ME GAY.  THIS IS PERVERSE.  It's ruining both their idea of power and their idea of sexuality.

One is 'wrong but understandable' and the other is 'terrifying perversion' because these people are intently focused on their idea of an ideal male-dominated hierarchy and they really love dressing it up in 'well actually, we're protecting women, see?' language to justify it.While on vacation this summer I had to listen to my partner's best friend & her daughters sing Trumps praises for about 2 hours while while my own daughter & I just rolled our eyes at each other. We finally had enough so we grabbed our floats & went to relax in the waves. 

We get back to our chairs & while drying off her friend says, "Oh yeah, Snoobs, I've been meaning to ask you about your experience with Obamacare. Oldest daughter is about to age off our plan so she needs something in 2025." I was truly agast at her lack of awareness & stupidity. Honey, your man is trying with all his power to abolish Obamacare yet you're telling me your daughter needs Obamacare & you think it's going to be there for her after you vote for him? How does this work exactly? 

The absolute ignorance of his supporters & how his intended policies will impact THEM is mindblowingly. The cognitive dissonance & lack of giving a shit about understanding what they are voting for is scary. I hope they get everything they voted & wished for. 

I know this is already long, but I also wanted to add that friend's teen daughter had an abortion about 2 months before our trip. It was common knowledge, they weren't embarrassed by it or anything, yet when the topic of abortion came up the next day, the whole family sat there & shat all over women's reproductive rights. They kept saying stuff like "whores shouldn't be rewarded." Rules for thee but not for me was out in full force.I can imagine a lot of Republicans transitioning if they didn't go after trans people.

For over a decade I was "just a crossdresser". I was also a conservative at that time. Want to know how many like-minded conservatives I met who "crossdressed" while we traded stories about our childhood and how we wished we were born as women? **TONS.** It was about 80% of the forum users over at crossdressers.com, if not more.

And heck, I even had a boomer neighbor who was "just a crossdresser". I'll slim the story, but "he" is partly why I started to figure things out. And as he started accepting herself, he stopped drinking, stopped (verbally) abusing his wife, developed a relationship with his kid, and so on. In other words, his life improved greatly. Then Trump came and I started hearing the beer bottles crashing into the recycling truck again. He still has his giant shed full of women's clothes, but now he was more than happy to throw crap at our house in a FOX News bender, scream slurs, and end up in court because he punctured the siding of our house. Oh, and he threatened to kill my cat, putting a skull and crossbones collar on him to show he could do it.The rest of Trump's platform is based on the very real losses, poverty, and isolation that the blue-collar working class outside of cities have seen. Farmers have always had it rough, but now it's even rougher with big commercial farms buying all the land. Small towns suffer when the manufacturing plant moves to Mexico and closes. So, he gives them an enemy they've already aligned to (these areas tend to be predominantly fundie) and punches down, knowing he can't meaningfully affect the rest. 

To restate it simply, he gives the people he's rallied a familiar common enemy. When he punches down, it feels like a victory to them. Then, Trump also has a very convenient scapegoat to blame when his plans don't work. 

There's been a very real shift of labor due to globalization that neither party has sufficiently addressed. To address it would take enormous actions of government such as including public college for free. Also, investing in infrastructure to create jobs, make the commutes to and from safer, and give rural areas internet access to ensure working from home is an option. The internet thing may come about because Musk owns Starlink, and there's a personal interest there. I doubt we will see meaningful progress on either of the others. There is more to it, and so more we won't see, but I'm not polsci, just business .We're also, oddly enough, pretty popular in their porn searches. I remember a few years ago when PH released their top searches by state, some Republican stronghold states had various trans search terms as the tops. Those states have since then made a concerted effort to make sure normal shit, like "lesbians" has become their top search. In fact, since PH started releasing that map, a lot more states are suddenly searching up "lesbians" on a more consistent basis (I don't think anyone knew PH was keeping track.)

I think part of the reason the red states are so interested in regulating us with laws so stringently is that they find us attractive, and they can't handle that. But red states also tend to be highly religious, and the religious have a long-standing history of blaming the object of their desires, rather than doing any introspection or taking the blame themselves. Just look at dress codes in schools these days. Girls can't even wear tank tops anymore if the straps aren't three fingers wide in many places. Girls having bare shoulders would be more harshly punished than the boys streaking through the hallways, if they could manage it.I haven't seen a single news outlet show it. 

If it wasn't for the internet, none of my friends or family would've known about it.

And with the photos, they immediately said "oh that's just a photo at an intentionally bad time -- they've done that with EVERYONE." And there's some truth to that, nearly every politician has a poorly timed out-of-context photo of them waving...or eating something phallic-shaped.

Then I showed them the video of Adolf Musk giving the good ol' Nope Ocean salute....*twice*....and they were speechless. Kinda hard to argue with that deliberate intent. He did it with fuckin' gusto.

And they were shocked to see no one else was reporting on it. "Why isn't this making headlines? The richest person in the world just gave the Nazi salute at the podium of the POTUS....on MLK day...at an Inauguration...and it's like it never happened."

Me: "Who owns all these news outlets? Hint: They're standing behind Trump in these photos."> It never stops, because they will always need a scapegoat and a common enemy for their base to rally against. Hating trans people is one of several tenets they have chose to unite the Trump base around, just like other fascists have done in the past.

If you want proof of this, look at how these attacks *started*. More specifically, they began their attacks on trans people in earnest ***right after losing the fight for gay marriage***.

This is also why some people mistakenly believe being trans is a "new, woke thing" and not something old. It's "new" because the right-wing hate machine needed a new target when gay people stopped working and so they lock-step spun on a dime and began the attack against trans people. 23 lawsuits in 23 different states, same day.

Once they've "defeated" (Read - ejected from society) trans people, they'll move onto gay people, and then democrats, or any group they deem "not american".

This isn't "slippery slope" because that fallacy requires that the further steps be ridiculously out of proportion. I.E. "If we give our kid a $5 allowance, he'll demand more, and the next thing you know we'll miss car payments because his allowance is so big!" 

But what they're doing is straight out of the fascist playbook. "There's an enemy, simultaneously so weak as to be derided, but so strong as to be a threat. Elect us and we'll Deal With the Threat"

The threat is always a boogeyman, a nonissue, but they need exactly that so that they can seem like they're doing something meaningful without costing the rich and powerful any money. Money, including tax revenue, isn't for helping The People, it's for enriching your buddies with contracts.
